# StrideBy Feature Ideas

Ideas to revisit later. Not prioritized — just a parking lot.

## Nearby Attractions Button
Replace the old "Nearest Place" button with a curated "Nearby Attraction" feature. Instead of just finding the nearest town by route distance, show famous landmarks and attractions near the user's current pin — Eiffel Tower, Strasbourg Cathedral, Colosseum, Mt. Fuji viewpoints, etc. Each route would have a hand-picked list of must-see spots with Look Around imagery. This is the thing that makes people screenshot and share.

## Shareable Postcard Milestone Cards
When users hit a landmark (cross into a new country, reach a famous city), auto-generate a beautiful share card with the landmark photo as background, distance traveled, and StrideBy branding. Sized for Instagram Stories (9:16) and feed (1:1). The viral mechanism — these need to look stunning.

## Passport Stamps
Collect stamps when you cross country or state borders along a route. Visual passport book in the Profile tab that fills up as you travel. Dover to Calais = UK stamp + France stamp. Crossing from Kansas to Colorado = new stamp.

## Social & Network Effects

### Shared Routes / Run Together
Pick a route with friends and see everyone's pins on the same map in realtime (via Supabase Realtime subscriptions). "Race" NYC to LA together. Leaderboard per route showing who's furthest. Low-friction invite via share link — tap to join someone's route.

### Activity Feed
See when friends hit milestones: "Sarah just reached Paris on European Crossing!" or "Mike completed Coast to Coast!" Lightweight feed in the Friends tab — not a full social network, just route-relevant moments. Push notifications for friend milestones on shared routes.

### Running Clubs / Groups
Create or join a group (e.g. "NYC Run Club"). Group picks a route and everyone's miles contribute to a shared pin. "Our club ran NYC to LA together in 3 months." Good hook for running clubs that already exist IRL — gives them a shared goal.

### Weekly Challenges
Time-limited group challenges: "Run 50 miles this week as a group to unlock the Tokyo route." Creates urgency and a reason to open the app regularly. Challenges could unlock new routes, cosmetic pin styles, or postcard backgrounds.

### Referral Loop
When you share a postcard or milestone card, include a deep link. Recipient taps it, downloads the app, and auto-joins your route. The sharer gets a cosmetic reward (custom pin color, special stamp). Make the viral loop as short as possible: see card → download → running together in under 2 minutes.

### Strava Integration Social Layer
Surface mutual Strava followers who also use StrideBy. "3 of your Strava friends are on StrideBy" during onboarding. Auto-suggest shared routes with people you already run with.
